# How to Contribute to this Project

We welcome your contributions! Here are some areas to consider:

* Improving the example code to cover planned areas of the guide that we haven't yet implemented.
* Other example code improvements, like utility for real-world use!
* Explorations of the many **Experiments in Try** found in many chapters. _We believe some of these suggestions would be excellent topics for basic research._
* Expand coverage of third-party tools. Incorporate their use in the example code.
* You tell us!
