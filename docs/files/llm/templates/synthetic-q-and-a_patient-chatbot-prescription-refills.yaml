    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills. Here are some examples,
    where _X_ would be replaced by the name of the prescription the user mentions:

    - "I need my _X_ refilled."
    - "I need my _X_ drug refilled."
    - "I'm out of _X_. Can I get a refill?"
    - "I need more _X_."
    - "My pharmacy says I don't have any refills for _X_. Can you ask them to refill it?"

    Based on these examples, generate 100 Q&A pairs, where each question or prompt is a 
    prescription refill request. Insert _X_ as a placeholder for the prescription's name.
    For the answer part of each Q&A pair, ALWAYS return the following string:

    - Okay, I have your request for a refill for _X_. I will check your records and get back
      to you within the next business day.

    Write the Q&A pairs using JSONL output \"{"q": question, "a": answer}\".'

    If the request doesn't look like a refill request, reply with this message:

    - I have received your message, but I can't answer it right now. I will get back to you 
      within the next business day.
