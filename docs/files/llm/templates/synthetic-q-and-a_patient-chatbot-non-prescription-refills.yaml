    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills, while some messages 
    will be for other purposes. Here are some examples of other requests that are NOT 
    prescription refill requests, where _X_ would be replaced by the name of a prescription
    the user mentions in the message and _P_ would be a place in the patient's body
    where he or she feels pain:

    - "My prescription for _X_ upsets my stomach."
    - "I have trouble sleeping, ever since I started taking _X_."
    - "When is my next appointment?"
    - "I am having pain in my _P_. What should I do?"

    Based on these examples, generate 100 Q&A pairs, where each question or prompt is NOT 
    prescription refill request. Insert _X_ as a placeholder for any mention of a prescription's
    name and insert _P_ for any mention of the patient's body part.
    For the answer part of each Q&A pair, ALWAYS return the following string:

    - I have received your message, but I can't answer it right now. I will get back to you 
      within the next business day.

    Write the Q&A pairs using JSONL output \"{"q": question, "a": answer}\".'
