# Our Healthcare ChatBot Example Application

This section summarizes the features of the running Healthcare ChatBox example applications. For additional information, see the project's [`README`]({{site.gh_edit_repository}}/){:target="_blank"}

{: .warning}
> **DISCLAIMER:** In this guide, we developed a healthcare ChatBot example application, chosen because it is a _worst case_ design challenge. Needless to say, but we will say it anyway, a ChatBot is notoriously difficult to implement successfully, because of the free form prompts from users and the many possible responses models can generate. A healthcare ChatBot is even more challenging because of the risk it could provide bad responses that lead to poor patient outcomes, if applied. Hence, **this example is only suitable for educational purposes**. It is not at all suitable for use in real healthcare applications and **_it must not be used_** in such a context. Use it at your own risk.

> **TODO:** This section will be completed soon. For now, see the discussions about the application throughout this guide and refer to the project's [`README`]({{site.gh_edit_repository}}/){:target="_blank"}
