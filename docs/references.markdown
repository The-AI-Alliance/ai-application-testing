## Specification-Driven Development

SDD is a more structured approach to prompting LLMs and doing explicit &ldquo;phases&rdquo; like planning vs. task execution, so LLMs can do a better job generating production-quality code that meets our requirements. Here we list many references. See the discussion in the [Specification-Driven Development]({{site.baseurl}}/future-ideas/sdd/) chapter, where we explore them.
