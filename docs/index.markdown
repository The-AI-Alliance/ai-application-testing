Welcome to the **The AI Alliance** project to advance the state of the art for **Developer Testing for Generative AI (&ldquo;GenAI&rdquo;) Applications**.

Using nondeterministic, [Genenerative AI Models]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#genenerative-ai-model) in an application makes it difficult to write [Deterministic]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#determinism), [Repeatable]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#repeatable), and [Automatable]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#automatable) tests. This is a serious concern for application developers, who are accustomed to and rely on determinism when they write [Unit]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#unit-test), [Integration]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#integration-test), and [Acceptance]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#acceptance-test) tests to verify expected behavior and ensure that no [Regressions]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#regression) occur as the application code base evolves.

What can be done about this problem?

## Project Goals

The goals of this project are two fold:

1. Research strategies and techniques for testing Generative AI applications that eliminate nondeterminism, where feasible, and enable effective [Repeatable]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#repeatable) and [Automatable]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#automatable) testing, where not feasible.
2. Publish guidance for developers on these strategies and techniques here and possibly other venues, like blogs and research papers.

> **NOTE:** This is very much a work in progress. This site will be updated frequently to reflect our current thinking, research, and emerging recommendations.

The content is organized into the following sections:

* [The Problems of Testing Generative AI Applications]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-problems) - An explanation of the problems in detail.
* [Testing Strategies]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-strategies/testing-strategies) - How to do effective testing of Generative AI Applications, despite the nondeterminancy.
* [Glossary of Terms]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary) - Definitions of terms.
* [References]({{site.baseurl}}/references) - Useful sources of additional information, some of which motivated the ideas here.
