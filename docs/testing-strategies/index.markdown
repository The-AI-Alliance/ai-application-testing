# Testing Strategies and Techniques

This section explores strategies and techniques that can be used to create reliable, repeatable tests for generative AI applications. 

We start with a reminder of general principles that have always applied, like _divide and conquer_ design approaches, then explore what new techniques developers can learn from their data scientist and model building peers.

Each page has a list of ideas we are exploring as _TODO_ items. See also the project [issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/ai-application-testing/issues){:target="issues"}.

> **NOTE:** Using a [Generative AI Model]({{site.glossaryurl}}/#generative-ai-model) can mean it is managed by the application itself, behind APIs or [Agents]({{site.glossaryurl}}/#agent), or it is used through direct calls to a separate service, like ChatGPT. When discussing models as components, we will often just use _model_ as a shorthand for all these cases.

Start with [Unit Benchmarks]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-strategies/unit-benchmarks/).
