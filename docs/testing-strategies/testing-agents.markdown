Agents are inherently more complex than application patterns that use &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; code wrapping invocations of LLMs. Agents are evolving to be more and more autonomous in their capabilities, requiring special approaches to testing. This chapter explores the requirements and available approaches.

## Other Tools for Testing Agents

### DoomArena

[DoomArena](https://servicenow.github.io/DoomArena/){:target="_blank"} from [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/){:target="_blank"} is a framework for testing AI Agents against evolving security threats. It offers a modular, configurable, plug-in framework for testing the security of AI agents across multiple attack scenarios.

DoomArena enables detailed threat modeling, adaptive testing, and fine-grained security evaluations through real-world case studies, such as Ï„-Bench and BrowserGym. These case studies showcase how DoomArena evaluates vulnerabilities in AI agents interacting in airline customer service and e-commerce contexts.

Furthermore, DoomArena serves as a laboratory for AI agent security research, revealing fascinating insights about agent vulnerabilities, defense effectiveness, and attack interactions.
