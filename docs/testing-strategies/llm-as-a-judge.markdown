# LLM as a Judge

In _LLM as a Judge_, a separate model, one that is very smart and also usually expensive to use or otherwise not suitable for production use in your application, serves as a _judge_ to generate Q&A pairs for the benchmarks. 

The judge model can also be used to decide whether or not the application model's response to a particular question is sufficiently close to the expected answer.

Issues you have to manage:

1. How do you validate that the judge model is producing good Q&A pairs and accurately evaluating the student model's results? This will require some human inspection of the Q&A pairs and possibly some test results, until some confidence is established. [Statistical techniques]({{site.baseurl}}/testing-strategies/statistical-tests) may also be useful. 
2. If the judge model is expensive or slow, how do you use it economically?
