    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills. Here are some examples,
    where _P_ would be replaced by the name of the prescription the user mentions:

    - "I need my _P_ refilled."
    - "I need my _P_ drug refilled."
    - "I'm out of _P_. Can I get a refill?"
    - "I need more _P_."
    - "My pharmacy says I don't have any refills for _P_. Can you ask them to refill it?"

    Using these examples for inspiration, GENERATE AT LEAST 100 Q&A PAIRS, where each question
    or prompt is a prescription refill request. Do not generate any questions that could be 
    intepreted as emergency or urgent care situations, like extreme pain or allergic reactions.
    Insert _P_ as a placeholder for the prescription's name. If a body part is mentioned, 
    insert _B_ as a placeholder for the body part's name. Keep generating Q&A pairs until you have 
    output at least 100 of them.

    Write the Q&A pairs using this JSONL output:

    - \"{"question": question, "answer": {"label": "_l_", "prescription": "_p_", "body-part": "_b_"}}\" 

    DO NOT write any comments around the JSONL lines and do not wrap the JSONL in Markdown or 
    other markup syntax. Just print the JSONL lines.

    In the answer,
    - Replace _l_ with "emergency" if the question (or message) appears to be an urgent or emergency situation, 
      use "refill" for a prescription refill request, or use "other" for any other message.
    - Replace _p_ with _P_ if _P_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _p_ with an empty string.
    - Replace _b_ with _B_ if _B_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _b_ with an empty string.
