    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills, while some messages 
    will be for other purposes. In some cases, the patient will need urgent attention, in
    which case they should stop using the ChatBot and call 911 instead. Here are some
    examples of other requests that should be interpreted as emergency situations,
    where _P_ would be replaced by the name of a prescription the user mentions in the
    message and _B_ would be a place in the patient's body where he or she feels pain or
    has some other question or comment about it:

    - "Since I started taking my prescription for _P_, I have trouble breathing."
    - "Since I started taking my prescription for _P_, I have hives all over my skin."
    - "Since I started taking my prescription for _P_, I have severe swelling."
    - "Since I started taking my prescription for _P_, I have severe stomach cramps."
    - "I have severe pain in my _B_."
    - "I have severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?"
    - "I have severe pain in my _B_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."
    - "I have severe swelling in my _B_."
    - "I have severe swelling in my _B_. What should I do?"
    - "I have severe swelling in my _B_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."
    - "I have trouble breathing."
    - "I have trouble breathing. What should I do?"
    - "I have trouble breathing. I think I need a referral to a specialist."
    - "I have a sharp pain in my chest."
    - "I have a sharp pain in my chest. What should I do?"
    - "I have a sharp pain in my chest. I think I need a referral to a specialist."

    Using these examples for inspiration, GENERATE AT LEAST 100 Q&A PAIRS, where each question 
    or prompt suggests the patient needs urgent or emergency care. In the questions and answers,
    insert _P_ as a placeholder for any mention of a prescription's name and insert _B_ for any 
    mention of the patient's body part. Keep generating Q&A pairs until you have output at least
    100 of them.

    Write the Q&A pairs using this JSONL output:

    - \"{"question": question, "answer": {"label": "_l_", "prescription": "_p_", "body-part": "_b_"}}\" 

    DO NOT write any comments around the JSONL lines and do not wrap the JSONL in Markdown or 
    other markup syntax. Just print the JSONL lines.

    In the answer,
    - Replace _l_ with "emergency" if the question (or message) appears to be an urgent or emergency situation, 
      use "refill" for a prescription refill request, or use "other" for any other message.
    - Replace _p_ with _P_ if _P_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _p_ with an empty string.
    - Replace _b_ with _B_ if _B_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _b_ with an empty string.
