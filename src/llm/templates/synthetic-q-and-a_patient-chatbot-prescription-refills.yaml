    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills. Here are some examples,
    where _P_ would be replaced by the name of the prescription the user mentions:

    - "I need my _P_ refilled."
    - "I need my _P_ drug refilled."
    - "I'm out of _P_. Can I get a refill?"
    - "I need more _P_."
    - "My pharmacy says I don't have any refills for _P_. Can you ask them to refill it?"

    Based on these examples, generate 100 Q&A pairs, where each question or prompt is a 
    prescription refill request. Insert _P_ as a placeholder for the prescription's name.
    If a body part is mentioned, insert _B_ as a placeholder for the body part's name.

    Write the Q&A pairs using this JSONL output:

    - \"{"question": question, "answer": {"label": "_l_", "prescription": "_p_", "body-part": "_b_"}}\" 

    Do not write any comments around the JSONL lines and do not wrap the JSONL in Markdown or 
    other markup syntax. Just print the JSONL lines.

    In the answer,
    - Replace _l_ with "refill" if the question (or message) appears to be a prescription refill or "other" for any other message.
    - Replace _p_ with _P_ if _P_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _p_ with an empty string.
    - Replace _b_ with _B_ if _B_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _b_ with an empty string.
