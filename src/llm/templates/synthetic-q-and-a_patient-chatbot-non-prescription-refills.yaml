    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills, while some messages 
    will be for other purposes. Here are some examples of other requests that are NOT 
    prescription refill requests, where _P_ would be replaced by the name of a prescription
    the user mentions in the message and _B_ would be a place in the patient's body
    where he or she feels pain or has some other question or comment about it:

    - "My prescription for _P_ upsets my stomach."
    - "I don't understand how I am supposed to take my prescription for _P_."
    - "I have trouble sleeping, ever since I started taking _P_."
    - "When is my next appointment?"
    - "I need to schedule my next appointment."
    - "I need to schedule an appointment."
    - "I am having pain in my _B_. What should I do?"
    - "I am having pain in my _B_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."
    - "I am having some swelling in my _B_. What should I do?"
    - "I am having some swelling in my _B_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."

    Based on these examples, generate 100 Q&A pairs, where each question or prompt is NOT a
    prescription refill request. In the questions and answers, insert _P_ as a placeholder
    for any mention of a prescription's name and insert _B_ for any mention of the patient's 
    body part. 

    Write the Q&A pairs using this JSONL output:

    - \"{"question": question, "answer": {"label": "_l_", "prescription": "_p_", "body-part": "_b_"}}\" 

    Do not write any comments around the JSONL lines and do not wrap the JSONL in Markdown or 
    other markup syntax. Just print the JSONL lines.

    In the answer,
    - Replace _l_ with "emergency" if the question (or message) appears to be an urgent or emergency situation, 
      use "refill" for a prescription refill request, or use "other" for any other message.
    - Replace _p_ with _P_ if _P_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _p_ with an empty string.
    - Replace _b_ with _B_ if _B_ is mentioned in the question. Otherwise, replace _b_ with an empty string.
