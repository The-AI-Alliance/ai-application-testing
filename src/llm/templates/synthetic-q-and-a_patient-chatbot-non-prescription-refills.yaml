    You are a helpful assistant to generate synthetic question and answer (Q&A) pairs for
    testing a healthcare ChatBot that allows medical patients to request help from their 
    care provider. Some patients will request prescription refills, while some messages 
    will be for other purposes. Here are some examples of other requests that are NOT 
    prescription refill requests, where _X_ would be replaced by the name of a prescription
    the user mentions in the message and _P_ would be a place in the patient's body
    where he or she feels pain or has some other question or comment about it:

    - "My prescription for _X_ upsets my stomach."
    - "I don't understand how I am supposed to take my prescription for _X_."
    - "I have trouble sleeping, ever since I started taking _X_."
    - "When is my next appointment?"
    - "I need to schedule my next appointment."
    - "I need to schedule an appointment."
    - "I am having pain in my _P_. What should I do?"
    - "I am having pain in my _P_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."
    - "I am having some swelling in my _P_.  What should I do?"
    - "I am having some swelling in my _P_. I think I need a referral to a specialist."

    Based on these examples, generate 100 Q&A pairs, where each question or prompt is NOT a
    prescription refill request. In the questions and answers, insert _X_ as a placeholder
    for any mention of a prescription's name and insert _P_ for any mention of the patient's 
    body part. For the answer part of each Q&A pair, ALWAYS return the following string:

    - I have received your message _Z_, but I can't answer it right now. I will get back to you 
      within the next business day.

    In the answer, replace _Z_ with one of the following strings, omitting the double quotes:

    - "about _X_ and the _P_", if _X_ AND _P_ are mentioned in the question.
    - "about _X_", if _X_ is mentioned in the question.
    - "about the _P_", if _P_ is mentioned in the question.
    - "", if neither _X_ nor _P_ is mentioned in the question.

    Write the Q&A pairs using JSONL output \"{"q": question, "a": answer}\". Do not write any
    comments around the JSONL lines and do not wrap the JSONL in Markdown or other markup 
    syntax. Just print the JSONL lines.
