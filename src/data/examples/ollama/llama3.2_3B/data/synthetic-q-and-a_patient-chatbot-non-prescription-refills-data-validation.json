{"question": "I am taking _P_ and I am experiencing some side effects.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is asking about side effects of a prescription, which does not necessarily imply a request for refill, emergency care, or any other purpose."}
{"question": "When is my next appointment?", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question does not contain any reference to prescriptions or body parts, only a general inquiry about an upcoming appointment."}
{"question": "My _B_ hurts when I do this.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is asking about a specific body part and its relation to an action, which doesn't align with the medical requests of refill or emergency."}
{"question": "I am having some trouble with my medication. Can you help?", "label": "other", "rating": 4, "reason": "The question seems to be related to medication, but the context is more about general assistance rather than a refill request."}
{"question": "How long does _P_ take to start working?", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The label is an excellent match because the question is asking for information about the onset of a prescription's effects, which is outside the scope of the ChatBot."}
{"question": "Can I get a doctor's note for my _B_ pain?", "label": "other", "rating": 3, "reason": "The label refill is likely a poor match because the question does not explicitly ask about a prescription refill, but rather asks for a doctor's note, which could be used to request a refill. However, the mention of body part _B_ and pain suggests that the patient may have a condition that requires a prescription, so the match is not perfect."}
{"question": "I need to reschedule my appointment.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is a generic inquiry about rescheduling an appointment, which does not relate to prescription refills or urgent medical needs."}
{"question": "My _P_ seems to be making me sick. Can I get a refill?", "label": "refill", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question clearly asks for a prescription refill and includes the placeholder _P_ as the name of the affected medication."}
{"question": "I have been having some issues with my _B_ lately.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The label 'other' is an excellent match for the question as it doesn't contain any specific request for a prescription refill or mention of an emergency situation."}
{"question": "Can you tell me more about the benefits of taking _P_?", "label": "refill", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is asking for information about a specific prescription (_P_), which indicates that it's related to taking medication."}
{"question": "I need to schedule a follow-up appointment.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question does not ask for a prescription refill or mention an emergency situation; it is about scheduling a follow-up appointment."}
{"question": "My _B_ is feeling really sore today.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question does not contain any mention of a prescription refill, and the body part being referred to is clearly indicated by the use of \"_B_\" as a placeholder."}
{"question": "How do I take _P_ correctly?", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is asking for information on the correct usage of a prescription, not requesting a refill."}
{"question": "I am having some issues with my medication regimen.", "label": "other", "rating": 4, "reason": "The question mentions medication regimen but does not specify a particular issue or need (e.g. refill), which aligns well with the 'other' label."}
{"question": "Can I get a copy of my prescription for _P_?", "label": "refill", "rating": 5, "reason": "The label is an excellent match because the question explicitly asks for a copy of the prescription and includes the placeholder _P_ which is also present in the answer."}
{"question": "I am experiencing some side effects from taking _P_.", "label": "refill", "rating": 1, "reason": "The question is asking about side effects from a prescription (_P_), which does not match the 'emergency' label that suggests a urgent care situation."}
{"question": "My _B_ is swelling up. What should I do?", "label": "other", "rating": 2, "reason": "The question appears to be requesting help with a medical issue, but it does not explicitly mention a prescription refill. The answer provided seems to focus on the body part rather than a medication."}
{"question": "Can you help me with my medication questions?", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question does not mention any prescription or body part, it is a general inquiry about assistance with medication questions."}
{"question": "I am having some trouble breathing. I think it might be related to _P_.", "label": "emergency", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question clearly states that the patient is experiencing breathing difficulties and suspects a relation with their prescription (_P_), which is a strong indication of an emergency situation."}
{"question": "Can I get a list of my prescription refills?", "label": "refill", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question explicitly mentions requesting a prescription refill."}
{"question": "My _B_ pain is really bad today.", "label": "emergency", "rating": 1, "reason": "The label emergency does not match the question because it seems to describe a medical issue rather than an urgent situation."}
{"question": "I am experiencing some nausea from taking _P_.", "label": "refill", "rating": 1, "reason": "The question is about nausea caused by a prescription, but the label indicates emergency which doesn't match."}
{"question": "Can I get a note explaining why I need to take _P_?", "label": "refill", "rating": 5, "reason": "The question is requesting information about the prescription _P_, which matches the label refill. The answer provided by the ChatBot also confirms this by labeling it as a refill."}

{"question": "Can you help me understand my medication regimen?", "label": "other", "rating": 3, "reason": "The question is asking for help with understanding their medication regimen, but the label 'refill' suggests a request for a prescription refill, which may not be the case in this scenario. The answer provided does not contain any information about a patient's body part or a specific prescription name, which further supports the 'other' classification."}
{"question": "I am experiencing some dizziness from taking _P_.", "label": "refill", "rating": 1, "reason": "The question is about side effects of a medication (_P_), not requesting a refill."}
{"question": "My _B_ is feeling really sore today.", "label": "other", "rating": 5, "reason": "The label 'other' matches the question well because it does not contain any prescription-related terms or references to urgent care."}
