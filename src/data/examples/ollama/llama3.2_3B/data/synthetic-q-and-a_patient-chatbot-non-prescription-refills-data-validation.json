{"question": "How do I know if I", "label": "refill", "rating": 2, "reason": "The question asks about taking too much of a medication, but the label indicates it's asking about knowing when to stop taking a prescription, which is more related to a refill."}
{"question": "I am having some swelling in my knee. What should I do?", "label": "emergency", "rating": 1, "reason": "The question is asking for help with a medical emergency (swelling) which typically requires calling 911 instead of using the ChatBot."}

{"question": "How long does it take for _P_ to start working?", "label": "refill", "rating": 2, "reason": "The label 'refill' is not the best match because the question asks about the time it takes for a prescription (_P_) to start working, which implies a wait period rather than a refill."}
{"question": "I am having some trouble breathing.

The presence of _B_ in the question further supports this classification."}
{"question": "Why does my _P_ make me feel so dizzy all the time?", "label": "other", "rating": 4, "reason": "The label 'other' is appropriate because the question does not directly ask about a prescription refill or an emergency situation.
