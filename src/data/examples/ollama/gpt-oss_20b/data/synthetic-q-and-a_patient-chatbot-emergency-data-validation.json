{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The patient reports severe pain, which often warrants urgent medical evaluation, so labeling it as an emergency is largely appropriate. However, the mention of a referral suggests it may not be an immediate life‑threatening situation, hence a rating slightly below perfect."}
{"question":"Since I started taking my prescription for _P_, I have a severe rash around my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The patient reports a severe rash that may be an adverse reaction, but the question does not mention life‑threatening symptoms (e.g., breathing difficulty, swelling of face or throat). Therefore, labeling it as an emergency (911) is somewhat inappropriate; a more appropriate label would likely be \"other\"."}
{"question":"I feel a tightness in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The statement could represent a potential allergic reaction or an adverse drug effect, especially if the body part is the chest, which would indeed be an emergency. However, because the placeholder _B_ could refer to any body part (e.g., arm, leg, throat), the urgency is not guaranteed. The label matches a possible scenario but is not unequivocally justified without more context, so the match quality is moderate."}
{"question":"I have a severe headache in my _B_ after starting _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question describes a severe headache after starting medication, which could be a medication side effect rather than an immediate life‑threatening emergency. Therefore the 'emergency' label is a somewhat poor match; an 'other' label would be more appropriate."}
{"question":"My prescription _P_ made me nauseous, and I feel faint.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The patient describes side effects (nausea and faintness) that may be concerning but do not clearly indicate an immediate life‑threatening emergency that would require calling 911. The label \"emergency\" is therefore a poor match for the question; a more appropriate label would be \"other\" or possibly \"refill\" if the issue were medication-related."}
{"question":"I had a seizure after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports a seizure after medication intake, which is a potentially life‑threatening symptom that warrants emergency evaluation; thus the 'emergency' label is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I feel like my heart is racing after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question suggests a potential adverse reaction that could be serious, but it is not clearly an immediate life‑threatening emergency. A cautious approach might classify it as \"emergency\" to prompt urgent medical advice, but it could also be handled as a non‑urgent concern. Therefore the label is only moderately appropriate."}
{"question":"I have severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain following medication intake, which is a classic indication of a potential medical emergency. The label 'emergency' is appropriate and accurately reflects the urgency of the situation."}
{"question":"I had a blackout after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports a blackout after taking a medication, which is a potentially life‑threatening adverse reaction that warrants urgent medical attention. The label 'emergency' is a perfect match."}
{"question":"I feel shortness of breath after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports a potentially life‑threatening symptom (shortness of breath) after taking a medication, which is a classic indication for emergency care. The label \"emergency\" is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I am having trouble swallowing after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a potential acute side effect (difficulty swallowing) after medication, which could indicate a serious allergic or obstructive reaction that warrants immediate medical attention. While not every instance of swallowing trouble is life‑threatening, the context of a new prescription and the symptom suggests a likely emergency scenario, making the label a reasonably good match."}
{"question":"I am experiencing vomiting after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question describes a symptom (vomiting) after taking a prescription, but it does not indicate an urgent or life‑threatening situation such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or uncontrolled bleeding. Vomiting alone is usually handled by primary care or a pharmacy review rather than an emergency response. Therefore, labeling it as \"emergency\" is a poor match."}
{"question":"I am having a severe allergic reaction to _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates a severe allergic reaction, which is a potential emergency situation that warrants calling 911 or seeking immediate medical care. The label \"emergency\" accurately reflects this urgency, making it an excellent match."}
{"question":"I am having trouble breathing after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Difficulty breathing after medication is a potential life‑threatening emergency, making the \"emergency\" label a perfect match for the question."}
{"question":"I feel a sudden severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The phrase \"sudden severe pain\" after taking a medication signals a potentially serious reaction that could warrant immediate medical attention, making the emergency label a reasonable match. However, without explicit mention of life‑threatening symptoms like difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis, the label is not absolutely certain, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I had a sudden drop in blood pressure after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The patient reports a sudden drop in blood pressure after taking a medication, which is a potentially serious adverse effect that may warrant immediate medical attention. While it may not always require calling 911, it is sufficiently urgent for an emergency classification. Therefore the label \"emergency\" is a good match, but the situation might also be managed by a clinician in some cases, so the match is not perfect."}
{"question":"I am feeling faint and dizzy after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports fainting and dizziness after medication, which are classic warning signs of a potentially life‑threatening reaction. This clearly indicates an emergency scenario where medical attention should be sought immediately, matching the \"emergency\" label perfectly."}
{"question":"I am experiencing vision loss after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates a potentially serious adverse effect (vision loss) after medication intake, which warrants an urgent medical evaluation. The label \"emergency\" accurately reflects the need for immediate attention, making it an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe headache that won't go away after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a potentially serious symptom (severe headache) persisting after medication use, which could indicate a dangerous side effect or a worsening condition. Labeling it as 'emergency' is appropriate because such symptoms may warrant immediate medical attention, making the label a perfect match."}
{"question":"I am feeling nausea and sweating after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The symptoms of nausea and sweating after taking a medication are concerning but do not necessarily indicate an immediate emergency that would require calling 911.  More typically this would be handled as a side‑effect or possible adverse reaction and would be classified as \"other\" rather than \"emergency,\" so the label is a poor match."}
{"question":"I have a sudden swelling in my _B_ after starting _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The sudden swelling after starting a medication suggests a possible allergic reaction, which is often considered an emergency. The label is appropriate, though the unspecified body part introduces some uncertainty."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes severe pain following medication intake, which could indicate a serious adverse reaction that warrants immediate medical evaluation, so labeling it as \"emergency\" is largely appropriate, though not every instance of severe pain is life‑threatening, hence a rating of 4."}
{"question":"I am experiencing rapid heartbeat after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":1,"reason":"The label \"emergency\" is a poor match for this question. While a rapid heartbeat could be concerning, the statement does not indicate a life‑threatening scenario that would require dialing 911. It is more appropriately classified as a medical inquiry (\"other\") rather than an emergency."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest tightness after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Chest tightness can indicate a serious allergic reaction or cardiovascular event, so an emergency response is appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe swelling in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The patient reports severe swelling following medication use, which could indicate a serious allergic reaction or adverse event. This warrants urgent medical attention, making 'emergency' a suitable label, though the exact severity (e.g., anaphylaxis vs. localized swelling) isn't fully clear, so the match is strong but not absolute."}
{"question":"I am having a severe headache after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question describes a possible adverse reaction to a medication, which may be serious but does not clearly indicate an immediate life‑threatening emergency that would require calling 911. A more appropriate label might be \"other\" or \"refill\" if a prescription was involved, but \"emergency\" appears to be an over‑classification."}
{"question":"I have a sudden difficulty breathing after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Sudden difficulty breathing after taking medication can signal a severe allergic reaction or acute adverse effect, requiring immediate medical attention. The 'emergency' label accurately reflects the urgency of the situation."}
{"question":"I am feeling a severe nausea after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question reports severe nausea after taking a medication, which is not a classic emergency symptom (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness). It is more appropriately classified as 'other' rather than 'emergency'."}
{"question":"I am experiencing severe dizziness after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The patient reports severe dizziness after taking a medication, which could indicate a serious side effect. However, it is not definitively an emergency requiring 911; it may warrant medical evaluation but is more appropriately classified as 'other' or possibly a medication side‑effect concern rather than an immediate emergency."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe symptom (burning sensation) after taking medication, which could indicate an allergic reaction or other emergency situation; thus the 'emergency' label is largely appropriate, though not absolutely guaranteed."}
{"question":"I have a severe swelling in my face after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates severe facial swelling after medication, which could represent an anaphylactic reaction—a true medical emergency. Thus the label 'emergency' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question indicates a potentially serious adverse reaction to a medication, which justifies an emergency label. However, without explicit life‑threatening symptoms, it might also be classified as a general urgent medical concern rather than a true emergency, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The patient reports severe pain after medication, which could be a serious side effect, but the context is not clearly an immediate emergency requiring 911. The label 'emergency' is somewhat overkill; a more appropriate label might be 'other' or 'referral'."}
{"question":"I have a severe breathing difficulty in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe breathing difficulty after taking a medication, which is a clear indication of a potential emergency situation requiring immediate medical attention (e.g., calling 911). The label 'emergency' is an excellent match for the content."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain after taking a medication, which is a classic red‑flag symptom that could indicate a life‑threatening condition such as a heart attack. This is a textbook example of an emergency scenario where the patient should be advised to seek immediate medical care or call emergency services. Therefore, the label \"emergency\" is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash after medication, indicating a potentially serious allergic reaction that warrants emergency care."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a potentially serious reaction (a severe rash after taking a medication), which could warrant urgent attention. However, the patient only requests a referral rather than indicating immediate danger (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/neck). The label 'emergency' is somewhat appropriate but not unequivocal, so the match is moderate."}
{"question":"I have a severe headache in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe headache after medication, which could signal a serious adverse reaction or neurological event. It is reasonably urgent and could warrant emergency care, so the 'emergency' label is a good but not unequivocally definitive match."}
{"question":"I have a severe headache in my _B_ after taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe headache following medication, which could indicate an adverse reaction or an acute neurological event. While it is not 100% certain that an emergency is required, the symptoms and the patient’s urgency to get a referral justify labeling it as potentially emergency. Thus the label is largely appropriate, though a definitive emergency determination would need more clinical detail."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe abdominal pain after taking a medication, which could indicate a serious reaction or complication. The label 'emergency' appropriately signals that the patient may need urgent medical attention, matching the severity of the symptom. No mismatch is evident."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":1,"reason":"The question describes a symptom that could be serious but does not indicate an immediate life‑threatening situation that would require calling 911. It is more appropriately classified as a non‑urgent medical concern (\"other\") rather than an emergency. The label \"emergency\" is therefore a poor match for the question."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes severe pain in a body part and a concern about needing a referral, which suggests an urgent medical situation. While it might not be an absolute life‑threatening emergency, it is a high‑risk scenario where calling 911 or seeking urgent care is appropriate, making the \"emergency\" label largely correct. However, because the question could also be interpreted as a request for a referral rather than a direct emergency, the rating is slightly less than perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes severe pain, which could signal an urgent or emergency situation. However, because the description is vague and doesn't mention life‑threatening symptoms (e.g., chest pain, breathing difficulty, loss of consciousness), the label is appropriate but not fully certain, hence a rating of 4."}
{"question":"I have a severe breathing difficulty after taking _P_ and I'm feeling faint.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes acute breathing difficulty and faintness, which are clear emergency symptoms that warrant calling emergency services; thus the 'emergency' label is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe swelling in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a potentially life‑threatening symptom (severe swelling) while the label correctly flags it as an emergency. No ambiguity or mismatch is present."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. I think I need a referral.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The statement indicates a rash and a desire for a referral, which does not clearly signal an emergency. It is more consistent with a non-urgent, general concern that would likely fall under the 'other' category."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_ and I'm feeling faint.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe abdominal pain and faintness, which are symptoms of a potentially life‑threatening drug reaction or internal bleed, warranting emergency care."}
{"question":"I have a severe headache after taking _P_ and I feel dizzy.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The symptoms described (severe headache and dizziness) after taking a medication could signal a serious adverse reaction or medical emergency, making the \"emergency\" label largely appropriate, though it may not be 100% certain."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_ and I feel faint.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain and fainting after medication, which are classic red‑flag symptoms for a potential cardiac event or other medical emergency, warranting a 911 call rather than a simple prescription refill. The emergency label is an excellent match for the content."}
{"question":"I have a severe breathing difficulty after taking _P_ and I'm feeling faint.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports severe breathing difficulty and faintness after taking a prescription, indicating a life‑threatening reaction that requires immediate medical attention; thus the 'emergency' label is a perfect match."}

{"question":"I have a severe nausea after taking _P_ and I'm feeling faint.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The patient reports severe nausea and feeling faint, which could indicate a serious adverse reaction. While it may warrant medical attention, it is not definitively an emergency like chest pain or breathing difficulty; thus the label is largely appropriate but not unequivocally clear."}
{"question":"I have a severe dizziness after taking _P_ and I'm feeling faint.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes acute symptoms—severe dizziness and faintness—after medication intake, which are potentially life‑threatening and warrant emergency advice; thus the 'emergency' label matches well."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The statement \"severe pain\" is vague and does not explicitly indicate a life‑threatening or life‑endangering situation that would require calling 911. It could be a medication side effect or an isolated painful reaction that may be managed by a provider. Therefore the emergency label is only a borderline match and is likely too strong for this context."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could potentially be an emergency if it is widespread, painful, or accompanied by systemic symptoms. However, the question lacks additional context (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling, spreading rash), so the label is plausible but not definitively supported."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe pain in a body part, indicating a potentially urgent medical situation that should be directed to emergency services."}

{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question indicates a severe burning sensation, which could be a sign of an urgent condition such as an infection, severe skin burn, or other acute issue. While it’s not definitively a life‑threatening emergency, the severity warrants caution and the label \"emergency\" is a reasonable match. However, the description could also fit a non‑urgent symptom, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The symptom of severe abdominal pain after medication could potentially indicate a serious adverse reaction that might warrant immediate medical attention, but it is not definitively an emergency requiring 911. Thus the label is moderately appropriate but somewhat ambiguous."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a non‑emergency adverse reaction to a medication, so classifying it as \"other\" is appropriate. The label correctly matches the content, warranting a perfect score."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question explicitly states severe pain, which could indicate an emergency situation, matching the 'emergency' label."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The symptom description suggests potential urgency, but it is not clear that the situation is life‑threatening or requires immediate emergency response.

The label 'emergency' accurately reflects the need for urgent medical attention, making it an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a potentially uncomfortable side effect that may require medical advice, but it does not explicitly indicate an emergency (e.g., life‑threatening symptoms or call 911). Thus, labeling it as \"other\" is appropriate and likely correct. The rating of 4 reflects a good match, with room for improvement in clarifying the severity if needed."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question is about an adverse reaction to a medication, not a prescription refill request and it does not indicate an emergency situation requiring 911. Therefore, the label 'other' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question reports severe pain, which could be an emergency, but the body part is unspecified and could be a non-emergency issue.

{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_.","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a side effect (severe sore throat) from a medication but does not request a refill nor indicate a life‑threatening emergency. Therefore, labeling it as 'other' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question indicates a potentially serious symptom (severe stomach cramp) following medication use, which could signal a dangerous adverse reaction such as gastrointestinal perforation or severe allergic reaction. While not every instance of severe abdominal pain is a true emergency, the wording suggests the need for urgent evaluation, making \"emergency\" a fairly appropriate label. However, without additional context, a definitive triage is uncertain, hence a rating of 4 rather than 5."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Chest pain is a classic red‑flag symptom that could indicate a serious adverse reaction or cardiovascular event, so the emergency label is highly appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could be an urgent situation, but without more context (e.g., breathing difficulty, widespread symptoms) it is not definitively an emergency.

{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question indicates severe abdominal pain after medication, which could potentially be an emergency (e.g., severe allergic reaction, internal injury). However, without additional symptoms like vomiting, difficulty breathing, or shock, it may be appropriate to seek medical advice rather than immediately dialing 911. Therefore, the label is moderately appropriate but not a perfect match. "}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_.","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The label 'other' appropriately classifies the question; it is not a prescription refill request, nor does it clearly indicate a life‑threatening emergency requiring 911. Thus the label is a perfect match."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question mentions severe pain and current medication, which suggests a potentially urgent situation that warrants medical attention.

The label \"emergency\" is likely too strong; it would be more appropriate as \"other\" or \"refill\" if a prescription was involved."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_.","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The patient is reporting a non-emergent side effect (sore throat) after taking a medication. The issue does not require immediate emergency care nor is it a request for a prescription refill. Therefore the label \"other\" appropriately matches the question."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe burning sensation after taking a medication, which could indicate a serious adverse reaction or allergic response that may warrant emergency care. While the label \"emergency\" is reasonable, there is some uncertainty without more specific symptoms (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing) to definitively confirm an emergency situation."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_.

{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe abdominal pain following medication ingestion, which is potentially an emergency situation. The label 'emergency' is appropriate, though a definitive emergency status (e.g., need to call 911) might require more detail, but overall the match is strong."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":4,"reason":"The label \"other\" reasonably captures that the question is about a possible adverse reaction to a prescription rather than a clear emergency (like chest pain or severe breathing difficulty) or a direct refill request. It is a good match, though a higher urgency could be considered, hence a rating of 4."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain following medication use, which is a classic scenario for a medical emergency that warrants calling emergency services. The label \"emergency\" accurately reflects the urgency of the situation."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question indicates a potentially serious reaction to a prescription, which could warrant an emergency response. The label emergency is largely appropriate, though it could also be classified as a medical issue that might not require calling 911. The placeholders are correctly used."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a severe symptom (burning sensation) that could indicate a potentially dangerous or life‑threatening condition. The label \"emergency\" is appropriate and aligns well with the urgency implied by the description. Hence it receives a perfect rating."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could potentially be an urgent dermatologic emergency, but it is not explicit enough to confirm that the patient should dial 911. The label \"emergency\" is only moderately appropriate; a safer classification might be \"other\"."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The statement of severe pain combined with medication use suggests a potential urgent situation, which aligns reasonably well with the 'emergency' label. However, without specific details about the medication or the nature of the pain, there remains some uncertainty that it might not be an actual emergency, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The phrase \"severe pain\" signals a potentially urgent medical condition, making the emergency label a reasonable match. However, without additional context (e.g., type of pain, associated symptoms, or time course) it cannot be confirmed as a true emergency, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe symptom that could indicate an emergency, but it is not explicit enough (e.g., lack of other acute indicators) to be a definitive 911 scenario. The label is moderately appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Chest pain after taking a medication can indicate a serious medical emergency such as a heart attack or severe allergic reaction. The label 'emergency' appropriately signals the need for urgent care."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports a severe burning sensation in a body part, indicating a potentially urgent medical issue that may require immediate attention, making the 'emergency' label a good match."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates a severe rash, which could represent a serious allergic reaction or infection requiring immediate medical evaluation. Therefore labeling it as 'emergency' is appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe pain which may indicate an urgent medical situation; labeling it as \"emergency\" is appropriate and matches the content."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain, a potential emergency situation, so the label 'emergency' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The statement describes a potentially serious symptom, but without specifying the body part or context it is unclear if it warrants calling emergency services. The label 'emergency' could be correct in some cases but is not definitively supported by the question alone."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe abdominal cramp after medication ingestion, which could indicate a serious reaction or adverse effect. It likely warrants urgent medical evaluation, so labeling it as 'emergency' is appropriate. However, the scenario could also be managed with medical guidance, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question reports a side effect after medication use, which is not an emergency situation (no immediate danger or call 911 required) and not a refill request. Therefore, labeling it as 'other' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The statement indicates a potentially serious adverse reaction, but lacks explicit signs of an acute emergency (e.g., breathing difficulty, swelling). It could be urgent, but not conclusively an emergency; thus the label is somewhat appropriate but not definitive."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question indicates a potentially urgent condition, but a severe rash alone does not necessarily require calling 911; it could be managed by a clinician or urgent care. Thus the label \"emergency\" is only a moderate match."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports severe pain after taking a medication, which could indicate an adverse reaction or serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. This aligns well with the emergency label."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain following medication intake, which is a classic red flag for a potential medical emergency (e.g., heart attack, drug reaction). The label 'emergency' is an excellent match to the content."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could indicate an urgent medical issue such as an allergic reaction or infection. The patient is seeking advice, so labeling it as 'emergency' is a reasonable match, though not all severe rashes require immediate 911; hence a rating of 4."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe pain in a body part, which is a clear sign of an urgent medical situation. Labeling it as \"emergency\" is appropriate and aligns well with the content of the question. This represents an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Severe chest pain after medication intake is a classic indicator of a potentially life‑threatening reaction that warrants immediate emergency care; the 'emergency' label is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The wording \"severe\" and \"burning sensation\" suggests a potentially urgent or painful symptom that could warrant an emergency evaluation, so the \"emergency\" label is a reasonably good match, but without specifying the body part or severity level, it is not absolutely certain."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe symptom (stomach cramp) that could be indicative of a serious adverse reaction to medication, which justifies labeling it as an emergency. However, it is not guaranteed to be a 911 situation, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The patient is describing a side effect (severe sore throat) after taking a medication, but there is no indication of an emergency or a refill request. Therefore the label 'other' is an appropriate match."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question mentions severe pain after medication, which could indicate an adverse reaction, but the information is insufficient to confirm it requires immediate emergency care (911). The label \"emergency\" is a plausible but not definitive match, so it gets a moderate score."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could be an urgent or emergency situation, making the 'emergency' label largely appropriate, though the lack of specific symptoms (e.g., breathing issues) means it is not definitively an emergency."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports severe chest pain, a classic red‑flag symptom that warrants urgent medical evaluation; thus the 'emergency' label accurately reflects the need for immediate care."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The phrasing indicates significant discomfort that could signal a serious condition (e.g., infection, chemical burn), which justifies labeling it as an emergency. The label aligns reasonably well with the question, though it could also potentially be managed in urgent care rather than 911, so it's not a perfect match."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The symptom described (severe stomach cramp after taking a medication) could be a side effect or mild adverse reaction, but it does not clearly indicate an emergency requiring 911. The label 'emergency' is therefore only a moderate fit, and a more appropriate label might be 'other'."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":4,"reason":"The label 'other' appropriately captures a non-refill, non-emergency inquiry about a potential side effect. It is unlikely to be a 911 situation, but the patient is seeking medical guidance. The label matches the question well, though a more specific 'adverse reaction' category could improve clarity."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question indicates severe pain, which could be an emergency, so the label is likely correct, but the lack of explicit life‑threatening symptoms means the match is not absolute."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The severe rash after medication could indicate an allergic reaction that may be life‑threatening, so labeling it as an emergency is largely appropriate, although it could also be handled by urgent non‑911 care."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question indicates a severe rash, which could be an emergency if it is part of an allergic reaction or signs of systemic involvement. However, with no additional symptoms (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling, fever), it is not definitively an emergency. The label \"emergency\" is somewhat appropriate but not a clear match, so a moderate rating of 2 is given."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question explicitly states severe pain in a body part, which is a typical scenario requiring urgent medical attention; therefore, labeling it as \"emergency\" is appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes severe chest pain following ingestion of a medication, which is a classic symptom warranting immediate medical attention and possible emergency services. The label \"emergency\" is highly appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"While the symptom is described as severe, the information given (a burning sensation in a body part) is ambiguous and could represent a non-emergency issue such as a rash, sunburn, or mild irritation. Without additional context indicating a life-threatening situation, labeling it as an emergency may be too strong."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The patient reports severe abdominal pain after medication use, which could be an adverse reaction but is not clearly an emergency requiring 911. The label is borderline; an \"other\" or \"refill\" category might be more appropriate, so the match is moderate."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question is about a symptom following medication use, not a prescription refill request nor an obvious emergency needing 911. Thus the label 'other' is an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates a severe chest pain, a potentially life‑threatening symptom, especially when it occurs after taking a medication. This is a clear indication of an emergency situation where calling 911 is appropriate, making the label \"emergency\" an excellent match."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question indicates a severe rash, which could potentially be an emergency if it spreads rapidly or is accompanied by breathing difficulty, but the description alone is not definitive enough to guarantee an emergency. A more conservative label such as \"other\" might be more appropriate unless additional symptoms are present."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question reports severe pain in a body part, which could indicate an emergency but is not explicitly urgent. The label \"emergency\" is a somewhat reasonable but not definitive match, so a moderate rating is appropriate."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"Severe chest pain is a classic warning sign of a potential cardiac event or serious drug reaction, warranting immediate medical attention. The label 'emergency' matches the urgency implied in the question. "}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The description of a severe burning sensation could indicate a potentially serious medical issue, such as a severe infection or allergic reaction, making an emergency label reasonable. However, without additional context (e.g., duration, associated symptoms), it is not unequivocally clear that 911 is required, so the label is a strong but not perfect match."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":1,"reason":"The question describes a stomach cramp after medication use, which is likely a side effect rather than a life‑threatening emergency; thus the label 'emergency' is not a good match."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The user is describing a side effect of a medication and is asking for advice. This is not a prescription refill request or an immediate emergency scenario. The label \"other\" correctly categorizes the query, making the match excellent."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ and I'm taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question clearly indicates severe pain in a body part, which is a potential emergency situation. Label \"emergency\" matches the intent accurately."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The phrase \"severe rash\" suggests a potentially urgent issue, but without more context (e.g., breathing difficulty, spreading rapidly, or systemic symptoms) it is unclear whether this truly warrants an emergency label. Therefore the match is moderate."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a severe burning sensation, which could indicate a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention; labeling it as emergency is a good match."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes acute severe chest pain following medication ingestion, a classic red flag for potential life‑threatening conditions (e.g., cardiac event or severe allergic reaction). This warrants immediate medical attention, so labeling it \"emergency\" is a perfect match."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The phrasing \"severe burning sensation\" suggests a potentially urgent situation that could warrant calling emergency services, making \"emergency\" a reasonably good match. However, without more context (e.g., location, onset, or associated symptoms) the classification isn't absolutely definitive, so the match is strong but not perfect."}
{"question":"I have a severe stomach cramp after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The description of a severe stomach cramp could indicate a serious reaction, but it is not definitively an emergency that requires calling 911. The label is somewhat plausible but not unequivocally appropriate, resulting in a moderate match."}
{"question":"I have a severe sore throat after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"other","rating":5,"reason":"The question concerns a possible side effect (severe sore throat) after taking a medication, which is not a prescription refill request and does not constitute an emergency that would require calling 911. Therefore the label 'other' is the correct classification."}
{"question":"I have a severe chest pain after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The patient reports severe chest pain, which is a classic red flag for a potential cardiac emergency. The scenario fits the definition of an emergency where the patient should be advised to seek immediate medical attention, such as calling 911. Therefore, the label 'emergency' is an excellent match for the question."}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates a severe pain after medication, which is a red flag for a possible adverse reaction or complication that could be life‑threatening. This scenario warrants calling emergency services rather than a routine refill or non‑urgent advice, making the \"emergency\" label a perfect match."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The patient reports a severe rash after taking medication, which could represent a serious allergic reaction that might require urgent medical attention. While it is not an overtly life‑threatening symptom like chest pain, it still falls within the scope of potential emergencies, making the \"emergency\" label a good, though not unequivocally perfect, match."}
{"question":"I have a severe breathing difficulty after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question describes a severe breathing difficulty after medication intake, which is a classic symptom of a potentially life‑threatening allergic reaction or respiratory distress that requires immediate medical attention, making 'emergency' the appropriate label."}

{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash, which could potentially be an emergency (e.g., an allergic reaction). However, a rash alone is not always an immediate 911 situation, so the label is somewhat correct but not definitively so. Therefore, the match is moderate. "}
{"question":"I have a severe pain in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":5,"reason":"The question indicates severe pain after taking medication, which is a likely emergency scenario, making the 'emergency' label an appropriate match."}
{"question":"I have a severe rash in my _B_ after taking _P_. What should I do?","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question describes a severe rash after medication, which could potentially be a serious allergic reaction. While it may warrant urgent medical attention, it is not explicitly an emergency that requires dialing 911. The label \"emergency\" is somewhat plausible but may be too strong; a safer classification might be \"other\" or \"urgent care\". Therefore the match is moderate, warranting a rating of 3."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The mention of a severe burning sensation after medication suggests a potentially serious adverse reaction or allergic response that could warrant urgent medical evaluation, making the emergency label a fairly appropriate match."}

{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_ after taking _P_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The question describes a potentially serious reaction that could warrant urgent medical attention; labeling it as emergency is reasonable, though it might also be managed by a primary care visit."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":2,"reason":"The question describes a severe symptom, but a burning sensation alone does not clearly indicate an emergency that would require calling 911. It could be a non-emergency medical issue that can be addressed by a clinician. Therefore the label \"emergency\" is a weak match for the question."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":3,"reason":"The question indicates a severe symptom, but a burning sensation alone is ambiguous; it could be a non-emergency issue such as mild irritation or allergic reaction. Therefore, labeling it as an emergency is only moderately justified."}
{"question":"I have a severe burning sensation in my _B_.","label":"emergency","rating":4,"reason":"The description of a severe burning sensation in a body part suggests a potentially urgent medical condition that may warrant emergency care. However, without more context (e.g., severity, location, accompanying symptoms), it is not definitively clear that it requires 911, so the label is likely but not guaranteed."}
