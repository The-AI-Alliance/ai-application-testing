# README for Developer Testing for GenAI Applications

[Published Documentation](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ai-application-testing/)

This repo contains the code and documentation for the AI Alliance guide for _Developer Testing for Generative AI Applications_, which explores the inherent difficulties and potential solutions for the desire to write deterministic, repeatable, automated tests when you have nondeterministic GenAI components in your application.

See the [documentation](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ai-application-testing/) for a more detailed description of the project.
